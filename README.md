# EDA-Capstone-1-Play-Store-App-Review-Analysis

For any business to succeed, going digital has become paramount, and getting an application
for your business can lead it toward more profits. None of us can now imagine our lives
without using apps on our mobile phones. Think of any problem you are facing in your life,
you will find a solution of the same in the form of an app specially curated to fix the issue for
you. As per the latest Google Play stats, there are 3.48 million apps currently in Google Play
Store and the number is constantly rising as around 3,739 apps are added to the Play Store
every single day.

Due to the constantly rising number of apps, it becomes imperative to understand the
parameters and patterns related to app creation from a business point of view. The Play store
datasets are quite intriguing as they consist of details like the number of installations, app
reviews, sentiment polarity, and so on. In this project, we dig deep into the datasets by doing
an Exploratory Data Analysis to see certain patterns that can be helpful for businesses in their
initial stages of App Development.

We began by in-depth cleaning the datasets and then merged them to create one dataset. After
that, we did a generalized analysis to get numerous insights. We particularly focussed on
consumer behavior and what components affect the decision of the user to install the app.
With the information gathered, we further tried to see if in the medical category, creating an app
would be beneficial. If so, what kinds of apps have a higher probability of being favored by
the audience.
